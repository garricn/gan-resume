<p><strong>I graduated from USC Law School</strong> in 2012 and worked as a lawyer for a year and a half. In the summer of 2014, I realized the legal profession was not for me, so I stopped practicing law and drove Uber while I taught myself Swift and iOS Development. Less than two years later, I was working full-time as an iOS Developer on the Mobile Engineering Team at Farmers Insurance. Our team was created to help spear-head the agile transformation of the entire company. It’s been an interesting opportunity. I’ve enjoyed my time at Farmers and am grateful for the experience. I learned so much over the last year, but the time has come for me to move on. I'm looking to - exactly as the job posting states - work with talented engineers, in a rewarding work environment, at a fast-growing company, with the opportunity to have an impact. Unfortunately, Farmers cannot provide all of that for me.</p>

<p><strong>In addition to working as an iOS Developer at Farmers</strong>, I’m also the founder of SwiftCoders.org, a member-driven organization that empowers people to use Swift and iOS Development for personal, career, and community growth. We create The SwiftCoders Podcast. I’ve released over 50 episodes of the podcast and I recently interviewed Chris Lattner, the creator of the Swift Programming Language. We also lead Learn Swift {CITY}, which helps people start Learn Swift meet ups all around the world. As of this writing, we have Learn Swift meet ups in 11 cities including Milan, Tokyo, Yerevan, Boston, Augusta, Asheville, San Diego, Ventura County, Los Angeles, Queens, and Portland.</p>

<p><strong>Currently, I’m focused on expanding my knowledge of Swift Application Programming</strong>, including Apple Platform Development, Server-Side-Swift, and Swift-Scripting. I’m also focused on honing my craft as an iOS Developer. I’m particularly interested in Test &amp; Accessibility-Driven Development with a strong emphasis on proper git-flow and using new design patterns such as MVVM and Coordinators. Besides my personal development as a Swift programmer, I’m also focused on furthering the mission of SwiftCoders.org. To that end, I'll be teaching Swift Development for 2 weeks starting in July at the TUMO Center in Yerevan, Armenia. I hope to find a new position shortly after I return from this volunteer teaching program.</p>
